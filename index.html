	<h1>It has been 10+ years since I've worked in HTML or JavaScript, so why am I back here?</h1>
	<p>I am currently working as a software engineer.</p>
	<p>The things that get me excited are (in no particular order)</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>writing clean, well-organized, modular code</li>
	 <li>exploring a new trail / route</li>
	 <li>keeping my bike, computer, tools, etc. well-maintained, when I want to use them, I expect them to be ready to go</li>
	 <li>photography, while I take drastically fewer photos than I have in years past, f-stops and ISO speeds are interesting</li>
	 <li>FreeBSD, Apple is built on it, so it must be pretty good</li>
	 <li>ZFS, if you're not using this, then you should - if you have important data, want to master managing your data, this is the filesystem to use</li>
	</ul>
